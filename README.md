# What this project does

This project was made as an assignment in an ASP.NET Core subject. It's aim was to practice ASP.NET Core development as well as design practices.

This project contains two separate programs

1. API that handles common REST requests
2. Blazor WebApp that works as a client administration tool for easier management of reservations 

## Use cases for this project

This project can be used to manage Rooms, where opening hours are defined which could be used to reserve Reservations for those rooms.

* Most of the administration work is done in the WebApp project as it was a part of the assignment, but the same thing could be done on the API side as well, all that is needed is just adding POST request handling.

* To properly setup this project you need to have
	* Docker installed
	* Knowledge how to operate nginx(TODO: Nginx links)
	* Pulled my server(TODO: Add docker links)
	* `docker compose -d`
